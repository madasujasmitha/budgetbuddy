    title: "Compound Interest",
    explanation:
      "When you earn interest on both your original money AND the interest you've already earned. It's like money growing money!",

  },
  inflation: {
    title: "Inflation",
    explanation:
      "When prices go up over time, making your money worth less. A candy bar that costs $1 today might cost $1.10 next year.",

  },
  "credit-score": {
    title: "Credit Score",
    explanation:
      "A number (300-850) that shows how good you are at paying back money you borrow. Higher scores = better loan terms.",

  },
  diversification: {
    title: "Diversification",
